(now 1/16th of the size of the original image) decomposition results that were
generated in the second filtering pasa Finally, Fig. 7.25(d) is the three-scale
FWT that resulted when the subimage from the upper-left-hand corner of Fig.
7.25(c) was used as the filter bank input. Each pass through the filter bank pro-
duced four quarter-size output images that were substituted for the input from
which they were derived. Note the directioffal ‘nature of the wavelet-based
subimages, Wi, Wy, andW?., at cach scale. m
The decomposition filters used in the preceding example are part of a well-
known family of wavelets called symiets, short for “symmetrical wavelets.” Al- ou uss the
though they are not perfectly symmetrical, they are designed to have the least support of « function is
asymmetry and highest number of vanishing moments’ for a given compact {+ Seri in which the
support (Daubechies [1992]). Figures 7.26(e) and (f) show the fourth-order vwlon.
The Ath moment of wavelet (x) is r(k) =f x“(x) dx. Zero moments impact the smoothness of the
scaling and wavelet functions and our ability to represent them as polynomials. An order-N symiet has
N vanishing moments.

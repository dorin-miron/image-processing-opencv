(now 1/16th of the size of the original image) decomposition results that were
generated in the second filtering pass. Finally, Fig. 7.25(d) is the three-scale
FWT that resulted when the subimage from the upper-left-hand corner of Fig.
7.25(c) was used as the filter bank input. Each pass through the filter bank pro-
duced four quarter-size output images that were substituted for ihe input from
which they were derived. Note the directioffal nature of the wavelet-based
subimages, Wj), Wy, and W7?, at cach scale.
The decomposition filters used in the preceding example are part of a well-
known family of wavelets called sym/ets, short for “symmetrical wavelets.” Al-

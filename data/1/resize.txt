(now 1/16th of the size of the original image) decomposition results that were
generated in the second filtering pass. Finally, Fig. 7.25(d) is the three-scale
FWT that resulted when the subimage from the upper-left-hand corner of Fig.
7.25(c) was used as the filter bank input. Each pass through the filter bank pro-
duced four quarter-size output images that were substituted for the input from
which they were derived. Note the directioffal nature of the wavelet-based
subimages, W//, WY, and W?, at cach scale. ®
The decomposition filters used in the preceding example are part of a well-
known family of wavelets called symleis, short for “symmetrical wavelets.” Al- yoo mar the compact
though they are not perfectly symmetrical, they are designed to have the least support of function is
asymmetry and highest number of vanishing moments’ for a given compact ee
support (Daubechies |1992]). Figures 7.26(e) and (f) show the fourth-order values.
1The kth moment of wavelet s(x) is m(k) = _[x*wlx) dx, Zero moments impact the smoothness of the
scaling and wavelet functions and our ability to represent them as polynomials. An order-¥’ symlet has
N vanishing moments.
